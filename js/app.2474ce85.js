During this time James worked alongside William Downie in both the cellar and vineyards giving up every spare minute he had to immerse himself in hands off winemaking and biodynamic viticulture. Team ARC firmly believe in ethical farming practices and in early 2020 they took on the lease of 3ha of established biodynamic vines just outside the town of Warragul. This amazing site is perched between the foothills of the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and Mount Baw Baw to the north. Its rich red volcanic soils produce wines of elegance, poise and character. In addition to their 3ha they have planted a very exciting close planted vineyard at home (Karinya Grove). This site comprises of Aligote, Chenin Blanc and Gamay grown at 475m in altitude with a permaculture philosophy. We are delighted to see A.R.C evolve as they continue to understand and learn from these magical sites.

From here Greg's has upped the ante, using organically grown Riverland oranges and lemons to create an intoxicating citrus hit. Finally he fortifies this blend adding neutral grape spirit which has been infused with a secret array of fruits, herbs and other botanicals. Bizzarro is a local aperitivo that perfectly balances sweet and bitter, making it incredibly versatile. Its less sweet than Aperol and less bitter than Campari giving endless options for your summer cocktail list. We recommend pouring it into pet nat for a delightful Spritz, or mixing it with local gin and vermouth for an all Aussie Negroni.",IMG:"assets/images/Bizzarro/Bizzarro-Aperitivo.jpg"},{ID:1,WINE:"Bizzarro Tonic",PRODUCER:"Bizzarro",COUNTRY:"Australia",REGION:"Riverland",VARIETY:"Tonic",STYLE:"Can",ABOUT:"Made in collaboration with the team from Mischief Brew Sodas, this is a mix of Bizzarro and their all natural, small batch Bengal Tonic water.

This time in the elbow which made him useless at holding a gun, luckily this time he was sent back to Australia. His stories amongst the family were legendary and his constant smile and mischievous behaviour was always something Daniel related to. For any of you who have met Dan you will of course know this to be true.",STORY_3:"Daniel grew up in central western New South Wales and from a young age was immersed in grape growing and winemaking. During school holidays he would pick up work with large wineries picking fruit or pruning vines. This led him to Charles Sturt University where he completed his double Wine/Viticulture degree at Wagga Wagga. His desire to understand different regions led him to vintages in New Zealand (Central Otago), Canada (Okanagan Valley), Portugal (Alentejo), France (Hermitage) and Italy (Barolo). After spending some time back in Australia working for Jacobs Creek his desire to start a small label focusing on organically grown grapes stated to burgeon. He knew that the mechanical, conventional way of doing things wasn’t for him and so in 2012 Sigurd was born. He moved to a smaller winery RedHeads studio wines, which he was given the task of re-invigorating. This also allowed Dan to explore his own label on the side. The first wine under Sigurd was a quirky single hogshead of Riesling fermented with Gewürztraminer skins just labeled as the white. From here a red GSM (now GSMN), Rose, Chenin, Syrah and now Carignan have joined the range with fleeting appearances of Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.\n        Every vintage of Sigurd is subtly different, be it a change in the blend or style to best show off that years conditions. For the most part Dan’s grapes are sourced or grown under organic principles, something he is working hard to have across the board. Once in the cellar his wines are as hands off as possible with only indigenous yeasts used, no adjustments of acid or tannin and minimal sulphur added at bottling (max 30ppm). He is proud of the Barossa Valley and his reds in particular speak of the richness of the terroir while still harbouring an immense freshness and drinkability, not always an easy task in one of Australia’s warmest regions.

His first vintage was in 2000, and since then he has expanded his father’s 3 hectares to the 17 hectares of vines he cultivates today. His vineyard work is meticulous and he is deeply in touch with his land.

His vines are spread across 58 parcels and are largely planted to indigenous varieties such as Zweigelt, Blaufränkisch and St. Laurent.",STORY_2:"More recently Claus has started working with Grüner Veltliner and Weissburgunder, producing distinctive, skin fermented white wines.

His winemaking methods are very much guided by instinct rather than set formula, and he is perpetually experimenting and evolving, making wine that is markedly different in style to the classic interpretations coming out of the region. Claus was one of the first Austrian winemakers to start experimenting with skin contact wines fermented in Georgian amphorae.

When Michael finished agricultural school in 2002 it was clear that he wanted to run the farm that his family had owned since 1807. This farm has always practiced mixed agriculture with crops, livestock, forestry and wine. Michael was fascinated with fermentation and took over the responsibility for vinification during his school years. He followed the common doctrine but was never happy with his early wines. It was only through stepping back and looking at the wines of his grandfather, a man who worked much more simply, with nearly no manipulation or intervention that Michael found his style and mantra. In 2012 Inspired by this he converted his winery and vineyards to Demeter bio-dynamics and began experimenting. Now Michael takes holistic farming to new heights with what he calls ‘close-circuit bio-dynamics’ - nothing comes into the winery, nothing comes out. This includes his barrels, which he makes himself from Acacia wood from the nearby forest.",STORY_2:"His 10 hectares of vines are planted extremely densely, with 7,000-10,000 vines per hectare growing on loam and loess soil. This forces the vines to behave highly competitively, resulting in low yields of highly concentrated fruit. He uses cover crops to keep down weeds and pest control is handled by the buzzards (Buteos) that roam the vineyards. He tucks his shoots instead of cutting them off at the top so that the energy of the plant goes to the fruit, rather than the stress of making new shoots at the cut end. A plethora of animals also inhabit the Gindl farm. Highland cattle have been bred since 2012, his 3 horses manage all of the work in the vineyards and a flock of goats and Breton dwarf sheep help to manage the weeds and increase fertility.",STORY_3:"In 2012 along with his certification Michael decided to rename and brand his property. He landed on MG vom Sol. Sol is the oldest vineyard ever documented in his hometown of Hohenruppersdorf, with plantings dating back to the 14th century. His grandfather revitalised this site, replanting to Gruner Veltliner and Weissburgunder 45 years ago. This remains the only Single Vineyard wine he makes preferring to harvest his 10 hectares by hand in three passes, picking on flavour and ripeness to create his special blends. To preserve the individuality and genuineness obtained in the vineyards, Michael try’s to do as little as possible in the cellar. The grapes are pressed very gently, rarely racked and fermented spontaneously without any use of selected yeast or temperature control. The wines remain on the lees for a very long time and selected cuvees get a small dose of sulphur dioxide before bottling.\n        Michaels is above all a farmer and a very talented one at that.

It comprised part of Champagne André Beaufort until 2018, when Amaury broke off from the family enterprise to pursue his own champagne production.",STORY_3:"Beaufort takes care to understate the differences that led him to break from the family estate and his négociant work with his brothers. But it doesn’t take much reading between the lines to see where Amaury’s priorities lie in viticulture. “For me the system is there always needs to be life in the soil,” he says. “Practically all the vignerons who work organically, they farm the vines, but they don’t farm the soil. They plow, they remove all the grass. Then it’s all naked. But there are a lot of microorganisms that need grass cover. I want my soil to play the role of a sponge. So when it rains, it absorbs it, and when it’s dry, only the surface dries out.” Here the under-emphasized issue is that maintaining grass cover entails a drop in yields, and the financial loss is all the more significant in regions where land is astronomically expensive. Beaufort also prefers to avoid vine trimming, finding it encourages root expansion and a greater resistance to pests and problems. Beaufort also credits late, careful pruning, in successive stages, with allowing him to avoid 2021’s catastrophic frosts.\n        In the cellar Beaufort ages his vin clairs for up to 21 months, this is extraordinarily long for Champagne vignerons working at his scale. With his close proximity to Burgundy, Amaury’s vinification techniques are more similar to Burgundy than classic Champagne. Fermentation begins in large 15hl oval casks. He doesn’t do battonage by hand, the shape of his casks allows for natural battonage. The wines are then transferred to Demi-muids for settling and further ageing. Wines are full natural fermentation with secondary fermentation from a selection natural yeast cultures the family have been using for over 20 years. No sulphur is added through the process and all wines remain unfiltered and unfined.\n        For us this is the most striking Champagne we have come across. It has a remarkable purity and linearity, something commonly seen in the past still wines he has produced.

All wines remain unfiltered and un-fined and in most cuvees zero sulphur additions are made.

Ludwig Bindernagel is know to his friends and colleagues as Lulu, so this affectionate nickname was the natural choice for the winery.",STORY_2:"Ludwig Bindernagel, from Bavaria, and Nathalie Eigenschenck, from Paris, started their journey into wine in 2000. Neither of them had any experience or formal education as winemakers prior to opening their own winery, nor did they come from vigneron families. Ludwig studied viticulture remotely while working as an architect in Paris, and ultimately decided to leave to pursue his passion for viticulture and wine production. Ludwig had fallen in love with Burgundy, and completed time working with a good friend in Saint Aubin. He had initially hoped to purchase land there, however due to financial constraints, the family found that the Jura proved significantly better suited for them. This led to the purchase of Les Chais du Vieux Bourg (now Lulu Vigneron) in 2000. Their first vintage came shortly after in 2002.",STORY_3:"The original vineyard is about 2.5 hectares in Arlay, in the centre of the Jura, and Ludwig has since expanded the estate to include vineyards in Poligny, l’Etoile and the legendary Château-Chalon.

They are currently going through biodynamic conversion for all vineyards and hope to achieve certification by the 2019 vintage. The soil is very unique, with two marly layers and a calcareous stratus, which is rich in fossilized oysters. Vine age varies from new vines of Trousseau that replaced his previous holdings of Pinot Noir to 55-year-old vines of Savignan.\n        Ludwig’s motto “the wine is made in the vineyard” is exemplified by the fact Ludwig works with the vines every day. He has a completely natural approach to wine making with a dedication to a non-interventionism and an affinity for making wine in a traditional style. He only takes the best clusters during selections, and uses almost mad pruning techniques to keep yields as low as possible. Ludwig’s fermentations are done at very low temperatures, lengthening the process for up to two years.

Interested in working with Mediterranean varietals, Tom managed to score a 3-month internship at the legendary Domaine Gauby in the village of Calce. Gérard Gauby quickly befriended Tom and asked him to come back for three consecutive vintages as cellar helper. During that time, Tom met his wife Nathalie, who just so happens to be Gérard’s sister.

The vineyards are un-irrigated, bush-vines pruned to the “gobelet” technique.The vineyards are worked naturally without any chemical aids. Tom is certified organic by Ecocert and uses biodynamic techniques such as Preparation 500 and various plant fermentations to activate and nourish his soils. Tom is passionate about continuing to diversify his agriculture away from simple monoculture.

Tom also sows up to 15 different plants in between his vineyard rows, which contribute to a greater diversity of soil microbiology.\n        Tom’s logic and ideas in the vineyard translate to the cellar where he aims to have a wine full of mineral energy.

Since 2009 all the vineyard work has been done according to biodynamic principles, receiving its Demeter certification in 2013. The estate consists of 11 hectares, 8 of which grow on the steep hill of the Mullay-Hofberg in Reil, a renowned winemaking village in the Mosel.

Later in Burgundy the Chevrot family taught him a lot about the concept of precision and balance in wines and that often this would be a result of precise work in the vineyard rather than interventions in the cellar. In 2018 Simone returned back to his home town Vincenza where he was able to agree to a long-term rent for a vineyard completely surrounded by the forest of Arcugnano above Lake Fimon - and planted with local varieties such as Garganega, Tai Rosso plus some obscure and unknown varieties as well as Pinot Blanc and Sauvignon.",STORY_3:"To this day Simone doesn’t own any winery or place, but instead keeps his modest tanks and concrete vats and equipment to the minimum. Since 2021, he is joined by a young oenology student Camilla, who is helping him to become even more focused on the vineyard (manual palissage work and rolling the apex by hand is just one of many steps) - something Simone believes will have even more positive impact on the grapes.

These two young Abruzzese have been friends since they were three years old.

They spent time learning from some of the biggest names of the ‘Natural’ wine world throughout both France and Italy. The influence of harvests with Jean Foillard and La Coste where they learned respect for soils, grapes and nature deeply shows both through their wines and overall philosophy. And so, without any degrees or diplomas they started to attack the vineyard work and fermentation in a very experimental spirit, but with the same desire to work with respect and without heavy-handed intervention. Despite both still working full time with other jobs they have managed to dedicate every spare minute to Lammidia, and the results continue to blossom.",STORY_3:"They have around 5 hectares of vines 700 metre above sea level in the hills above Pescara in the small village of Villa Celiera.

The majority of their vines are planted to Montepulciano and Trebbiano d’Abruzzo but they also have a little Pinot Noir, Barbera, Pecorino and Moscato. They do not move the earth in the vineyards at all but cut surrounding plant life and leave it as mulch on the soil to keep in moisture and to protect the surface. In the cellar they work predominantly with cement tanks but also use mediums such as Anfora and Fibreglass for some cuvees.\n        There is a great diversity throughout their range of wines as they work with different methods, such as white with skin maceration, Carbonique and whole bunch.
